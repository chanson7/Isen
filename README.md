This project is a prototype of a multiplayer horror game.  The "Hero" player spawns into a procedurally generated map filled with Mannequins in random poses.  Other players spawn as mannequins that strike a random pose when they stop moving.  The mannequins attempt to capture the Hero before the Hero escapes.
